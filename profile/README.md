# Sthenos Security

*Security engineering focused on reachability and real exploitability*

Engineering teams are overwhelmed by the volume of security signals. Traditional AppSec tools (SAST, SCA), CNAPPs, and SIEMs generate valuable data, but the sheer number of alerts creates fatigue—obscuring the critical path and making it hard to focus on what truly matters."

Meanwhile, AI-powered attacks evolve faster than ever, shrinking the window to detect and respond.

**Sthenos Security adds reachability insight to both static and runtime analysis**, giving teams a clearer picture of what’s actually exploitable. This lets teams make confident, deterministic decisions—cutting through the noise and eliminating issues that were never exploitable in the first place.
